# fee-share

This module shares contract execution fees with the smart contract developers as passed in [Juno Prop 51](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/proposals/51)

This module is a heavily modified fork of [evmos/x/revenue](https://github.com/evmos/evmos/tree/main/x/revenue).
A big thanks go to the original authors.
