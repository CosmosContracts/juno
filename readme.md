**Juno** is an open-source platform for inter-operable smart contracts which automatically execute, control or document a procedure of events and actions according to the terms of the contract or agreement to be valid and usable across multiple sovereign networks.

Juno is a **sovereign public blockchain** in the Cosmos Ecosystem. It aims to provide a sandbox environment for the deployment of inter-operable smart contracts. The network serves as a **decentralized, permissionless**, and **censorship-resistant** zone for developers to efficiently and securely launch application-specific smart contracts.

Juno originates from a **community-driven initiative**, prompted by developers, validators and delegators in the Cosmos Ecosystem. The common vision is to preserve the neutrality, performance, and reliability of the Cosmos Hub. This is achieved by offloading smart contract deployment to a dedicated sister Hub.

**Juno** is a blockchain built using Cosmos SDK and Tendermint.
